ASN.1 Serialization toolkit
============================
What is this?
-------------
ASN1S - is a set of tools to help developer send and receive data using ASN.1 protocol (probably only BER would be supported). Also you could use it as serialization tool, because you don't need to waste time and space to generate serialization stubs or something like that. All what you need is to transfer your objects to ASN1S serialization service, you could make process much more smarter if you make it once (will generate an ASN.1 scheme), edit scheme and every time after that use scheme to save your objects. No more stubs.

Features?
---------
* Completely automatic serialization and objects loading (via reflection API);
* ASN.1 scheme compiler to allow you build your own data structures (and types) and validate them;
* No blackjack and hookers.
