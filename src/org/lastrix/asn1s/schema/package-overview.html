    <title>ASN.1 Serialization: schema package overview</title>
</head>
<body>
This package contains utilities that help you load and handle ASN.1 modules, as described in ITU-T X.680.

You could use Schema.loadSchema(path-to-schema) to load ASN.1 module into an clear Schema which contain your loaded module and default module which
content is default ASN.1 type handlers. Of course you may override default module and use our own, in future.

To use your schema you need to call read and write methods. See Schema#read(InputStream) and Schema#write(Object, OutputStream) for more information.
Those methods will lookup for information built by modules and use it to call certain type handlers.
When you read from stream, the first step is to read Tag and find an type handler in specially created Schema#tag2type HashMap, next step is obvious.
And when you write the object to stream, Schema will look for type handler in Schema#class2type by object's class, currently no null values
supported.
